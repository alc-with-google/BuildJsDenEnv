/***********
Project Structure Tips
***********/
1. Put JS in a .js file
{
    Don't do this “I’ll just slap this JS in a script tag.”
    How do I…
    Test this?
    Lint this?
    Reuse this?
    Transpilethis?
    Import explicit dependencies?

    YOU CAN’T.
}

2. Consider organizing by feature
{
    - Organize by File Type
    /components
    /data
    /models
    /views

    - Organize by Feature
    /authors
    /courses
}

3. Extract logic into “POJOs”

{
    Plain Old JavaScript Objects
    Pure logic.
    No framework-specific code.
}
